# OOPs-in-Python
Object oriented programming in pythons

* One of the ways of solving programming problems is by creating objects.
* In python objects has two characteristics 
  * attributes - features of the objects
  * behaviour - functions of the objects
  
 * Object consist of Class. Class is a blueprint of the object defined.

> * Here we have created class animal.
> * animalcount is a class variable. It can be used inside and outside the class as an attribute
> * It consist of instance attributes, means which are created on the go and not predefined.
> * A function sound is defined under the class,which is method used by the object or behaviour of the object. 
> * **\_\_init\_\_** is a constructor to create the instances for the particular class
 
## Built in class attributes
  * __dict__ − Dictionary which contains the class's namespace.
  * __doc__ − Documentation string inside the class. if undefined it returns none.
  * __name__ − Retuns Class name.
  * __module__ − Returns Module name in which the class is defined. The attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode.
  * __bases__ − Retuns the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.
